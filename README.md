# python_snake
This repository contains an implementation of the snake game written in python. The main goal of this project is to implement an autonomous player with reinforced learning. Some academic information can be found here:
http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2016spr/report/060.pdf

Suggested tools:
Python 3.6
VSCode (However it's not working properly if you run it in the vscode terminal)

Installation:
Open your Terminal and move to your desired directory.
Enter the following command:
> git clone https://github.com/fanconic/python_snake

Run the Program:
A buildfile is already implemented in the repository, so that you can start snake_game.py by pressing Ctrl + Shift + B (The key inputs will though not be read by the embedded terminal of vscode)
Else you can just input in your terminal
> python3 ./snake_game.py

To build your own autonomous player, I recommend making a new python file or class

Have fun!
